				<h3>Project Description</h3>
				<p>This interactive map is part of a larger project entitled Rijeka in Flux: Borders and Urban Change after World War II. This broader project asks: how did the relocation of the border between Yugoslavia and Italy after the Second World War impact the city of Rijeka/Fiume, which the border had previously bisected? The objective of the four-year study will be to inquire into and record the various and interconnected ways in which the city was affected by this transfer, and based on these findings, to derive a methodology that can be fruitfully applied to other case studies. Scholars in the historical research team and their students will investigate different aspects of the city’s evolution, which they will share both through traditional scholarly outlets, and through the interactive online Rijeka/Fiume map. In so doing, they will generate what David Bodenhamer has called a “deep map,” that is: “an open, visual, and experiential space, immersing users in a virtual world in which uncertainty, ambiguity, and contingency are ever present”. The digital humanities team will conduct network analyses to the database supporting the map to generate new insights about change in Rijeka. The mapping team will develop a mobile phone app that will allow users to engage with the multiple layers of the city’s history in situ.</p>
				<p>Scholars have documented the significant exodus of the Italian population from Istria back to Italy, although their findings continue to be controversial and disputed due to their sensitive nature. Much, however, remains to be investigated. What impact did this exodus have on the city from a spatial and cultural perspective? In particular, what happened to the property that was left behind? What took the place of the traditional Italian elite? To what extent did Italian culture and language continue to play a role in Rijeka? What space did Croatian and other language groups occupy, and what role did they play, following the end of the Habsburg Empire, after the transition to Italy, then to Yugoslavia and, finally, to independent Croatia? The impact of the replacement of the Italian political and economic system by the socialist Yugoslav regime has significant implications for all these questions, and opens up new ones. What effect did the imposition of a socialist property regime have both on the built inheritance and on new urban development? How did the city’s incorporation into a new economic system change its economic profile, and with what consequences? These questions are also valid for the 19th century, with various changes in administration during the Habsburg era, and even more with the dramatic transitions of the 20th century, leading to the dissolution of socialist Yugoslavia and the establishment of Croatian independence. What impact did geopolitics and ideology have on the city? In seeking the answers to these questions, other questions will emerge. This iterative process will allow us to draw an inventory of types of change and continuity, which can then be applied to other contexts.</p>
				<p>“Rijeka in Flux” will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of the Second World War and its settlement for European societies. The map will help us to research the effects of the transition, and the complex history of Rijeka through the centuries, using a tool that allows for different voices to contribute, learn and develop knowledge of the city. In addition to our own research, others who wish to share their knowledge of the city can also make contributions to the map, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of Rijeka past and present.</p>

In addition to our research, which we will contribute to the map, others who wish to share their knowledge of the city can also make contributions to the map, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of Rijeka past and present.</p>
				<p>This study will both examine the attempts to engineer homogeneous communities in the newly acquired territories while also revealing the more complicated realities that prevailed in borderlands. It also provides a unique opportunity to examine the intersection of nationalist politics with the ideological and geopolitical dimensions of the Cold War. As such, this project is of interest to the fields of international relations, geography, political sociology, and the interdisciplinary fields of nationalism studies and Cold War studies. It can also contribute to the reconciliation and the improvement of relations between certain European communities and states, which continue to be strained by deep historical wounds.</p>
				<p>This project is generously funded by an Insight Grant (2018-2020) from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and builds on the “Cities and Regions in Transition: the case of Rijeka/Fiume” project, which was funded by an Insight Development Grant (2014-2016) and Connection<br />Grant (2017), also from SSHRC.</p>

Her publications on urban planning in socialist Yugoslavia include Designing Tito’s Capital: Urban Planning, Modernism, and Socialism in Belgrade (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014.) She is currently completing a monograph on the relationship between Yugoslavia and its migrant workers in Europe during the Cold War. Her research fellowships include a Max Weber fellowship (2007) and a Humboldt fellowship (2018). She is the principle investigator of the project Rijeka in Flux: Borders and Urban Change after World War II. Aside from managing the project as a whole, and coordinating the team of historians, she is carrying out research on the impact of the border and regime change in 1945 on the flow of people, goods, capital, and ideas in and out of the city. She is particularly interested in the ways in which these flows left their mark on the body of the city.

				Jon Corbett is an Associate Professor at UBC Okanagan, the director of ICER (the institute for Community Engaged Research) and the director of the Spatial Information for Community Engagement (SpICE) Lab. Jon is an enduring map geek. The practice side of his research explores how digital multimedia technologies can be combined with maps and used by communities to document, store and communicate their spatial knowledge. The theoretical side examines how geographic representation of this knowledge using these technologies can strengthen the community internally, as well as externally through increasing their influence over decision-making and their ability to become active agents in the process of social change. All aspects of his research incorporate a core community element. Within the context of his research program this means that the research is of tangible benefit for the communities with whom he works; that those communities feel a strong sense of ownership over the research process; and that community members are engaged and engage in the research endeavor. In the Rijeka in Flux project Jon’s role is to contribute to the design, deployment and evaluation of the technical components of proposed research, especially the programming required for the development of the augmented reality application. </p>
